1. Tell me about yourself.

"Hello, I'm [Your Name], a Python developer with [X years] of experience in building scalable web applications and automation tools.



2. What are Python's key features?

Python is an interpreted, high-level, dynamically typed language known for its simplicity and readability. Key features include:
Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
Extensive standard library and third-party modules



3. Explain the difference between lists, tuples, and sets in Python.

List: Ordered, mutable, allows duplicate elements.
Tuple: Ordered, immutable, allows duplicate elements.
Set: Unordered, mutable, does not allow duplicate elements.




4. What is the purpose of the __init__() method in Python classes?

The __init__() method is the constructor in Python classes. It initializes the object's attributes when an instance is created.



5. How does Python manage memory?

Python uses a private heap space for memory management, where all objects and data structures are stored. The built-in garbage collector recycles unused memory to prevent memory leaks



6. What are Python's built-in data types?

Common built-in data types include:
Numeric: int, float, complex
Sequence: list, tuple, range
Text: str



7. What is the difference between shallow and deep copy?

Shallow copy: Creates a new object but inserts references into it of the objects found in the original. Changes to nested objects affect both copies.
Deep copy: Creates a new object and recursively adds copies of nested objects. Changes to nested objects do not affect the original.



8. What are the principles of OOP in Python?

The four main principles are:
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones, inheriting attributes and methods.



9. How does Python handle multiple inheritance?

Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from multiple parent classes. The method resolution order (MRO) determines the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method.



10. What is the difference between class methods and static methods?

Class method: Defined with @classmethod decorator, takes cls as the first parameter, and can access or modify class state.
Static method: Defined with @staticmethod decorator, does not take self or cls as the first parameter, and cannot access or modify class or instance state.



11. What is an iterator in Python?

An iterator is an object that implements the __iter__() and __next__() methods, allowing iteration over its elements one at a time.



12. What is a generator in Python?

A generator is a function that uses the yield statement to return an iterator. It allows for lazy evaluation, generating items one at a time and conserving memory.



13. How does Python handle exceptions?

Python uses try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions. The finally block can be used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred.



14. What is the difference between assert and exceptions?

assert: Used for debugging purposes to test conditions that should always be true. If the condition is false, an AssertionError is raised.
Exceptions: Used to handle errors that occur during program execution, allowing for graceful error handling.



15. How do you perform unit testing in Python?

Python provides the unittest module for writing and running tests. Third-party libraries like pytest offer more advanced testing features.



16. What are decorators in Python?

Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or classes. They are often used for logging, access control, and instrumentation.



17. Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. It simplifies memory management but can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound multi-threaded programs.




18. What are context managers in Python?

Context managers allow for the setup and teardown of resources, ensuring proper acquisition and release. They are implemented using the with statement and define __enter__() and __exit__() methods




19. How would you implement a stack in Python?

A stack can be implemented using a list with append() and pop() methods to add and remove elements from the end.




20. How do you reverse a string in Python?

You can reverse a string using slicing: reversed_string = original_string[::-1].





21. How would you find the first non-repeating character in a string?

One approach is to use a dictionary to count character occurrences and then iterate through the string to find the first character with a count of one.




22. What are the differences between Django and Flask?

Django: A high-level, full-stack web framework with built-in features like ORM, admin interface, and authentication.
Flask: A lightweight, micro-framework that provides flexibility and is suitable for smaller applications or when custom components are needed.




23. How do you handle database migrations in Django?

Django uses the makemigrations and migrate commands to create and apply database schema changes based on model definitions.




24. What is a RESTful API, and how do you implement one in Python?

A RESTful API adheres to REST principles, using HTTP methods for CRUD operations. In Python, frameworks like Flask and Django REST Framework can be used to build RESTful APIs.




25. How do you deploy a Python application?

Deployment steps may include:
Setting up a virtual environment
Installing dependencies
Configuring environment variables
Using a WSGI server like Gunicorn



26. What is Docker, and how is it used with Python applications?

Docker is a platform for containerizing applications, allowing them to run consistently across environments. Python applications can be containerized by writing a Dockerfile that specifies the environment and dependencies.




27. How do you manage dependencies in Python projects?

Dependencies can be managed using tools like pip and virtualenv, and listed in a requirements.txt file for reproducibility.




28. Describe a challenging bug you encountered and how you resolved it.

Tip: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answer.




29. How do you stay updated with the latest developments in Python?

Mention resources like official Python documentation, blogs, newsletters, conferences, and community forums.




30. Why do you want to work with our company?

Tip: Research the company's mission, projects, and culture, and align them with your skills and career goals.
