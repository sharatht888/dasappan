1. My background includes experience in Python, strengths in Flask, achievements in database management, and goals in scalable web solutions.
2. Python is an interpreted, dynamic, object-oriented language with powerful libraries and cross-platform support.
3. Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable, and sets are unordered, optimizing indexing and performance.
4. __init__() is a constructor used for initialization, handling object creation and parameters through `self`.
5. Python uses garbage collection, reference counting, and heap optimization, following PEP 3121 standards.
6. Built-in types include string, integer, float, list, and dictionary for structured data handling.
7. The copy module allows shallow and deep copy handling, affecting references and memory allocation.
8. Python supports encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, organizing objects efficiently.
9. Multiple inheritance uses MRO and `super()`, solving the diamond problem while managing parent class overrides.
10. `@classmethod` takes `cls`, while `@staticmethod` doesn’t rely on instance or bound methods.
11. An iterator processes iterable objects using `next()`, raising `StopIteration` when exhausted.
12. A generator uses `yield` for lazy evaluation, enhancing memory efficiency and iterators' performance.
13. Python manages errors with `try-except`, `raise`, exception hierarchy, and logging for debugging.
14. `assert` helps debugging by validating conditions, while exceptions handle runtime issues with `try-except`.
15. Unit testing in Python uses `unittest` and `pytest`, relying on assertions, test cases, and mocking.
16. Decorators (`@decorator`) wrap functions, enabling higher-order control while following the DRY principle.
17. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) affects threads and concurrency in CPython, impacting memory management.
18. Context managers use `with` for resource management, invoking `__enter__` and `__exit__` for file handling.
19. A stack follows LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), using push and pop operations within a list structure.
20. Reverse strings using slice notation (`[::-1]`), `reverse()`, or recursion for optimized iteration.
21. Use dictionaries and OrderedDict for frequency count, finding the first non-repeating character efficiently.
22. Flask is a micro framework, while Django is full-stack, differing in routing, ORM flexibility, and scalability.
23. Django migration scripts (`makemigrations`, `migrate`) handle schema changes dynamically within models.
24. RESTful APIs in Flask or Django use CRUD operations with HTTP methods and JSON endpoints.
25. Python apps deploy via cloud, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and virtual environments for optimized performance.
26. Docker containers package dependencies, using images and orchestration for virtualization.
27. Dependency management in Python relies on `pip`, `virtualenv`, `requirements.txt`, and Poetry for isolation.
28. Debugging involves logging, exception handling, root cause analysis, and issue resolution strategies.
29. Stay updated with Python through documentation, blogs, conferences, open-source projects, and latest features.
30. I value your company’s culture, growth opportunities, contribution-driven environment, values, and mission.
