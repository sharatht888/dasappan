"I'm a Python developer with X years of experience in web applications and automation. My strengths include backend development, database management, and API integrations."

"Python is an interpreted, high-level, dynamically typed language with extensive libraries, cross-platform compatibility, and support for object-oriented programming."

"Lists are ordered and mutable, tuples are ordered and immutable, and sets are unordered collections that do not allow duplicate values."

"The init method initializes object attributes when an instance is created, allowing for custom initialization."

"Python manages memory using automatic garbage collection, reference counting, and heap memory allocation."

"Python's built-in data types include strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and booleans."

"Shallow copies create a new object but reference the same elements, while deep copies create completely independent copies of the elements."

"Python's OOP principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, which help organize and reuse code efficiently."

"Python uses the Method Resolution Order (MRO) and the C3 linearization algorithm to handle multiple inheritance and determine attribute lookup order."

"Class methods operate on the class itself using @classmethod, while static methods don't require a class instance and use @staticmethod."

"An iterator in Python is an object that implements the iter() and next() methods, allowing sequential traversal through elements."

"Generators are special iterators that use the yield keyword to produce values lazily, improving memory efficiency."

"Python handles exceptions using try-except blocks, allowing developers to gracefully catch and handle runtime errors."

"Assertions check conditions during debugging, while exceptions handle runtime errors dynamically with try-except blocks."

"Unit testing in Python can be performed using the unittest or pytest libraries, leveraging assertions to validate expected behavior."

"Decorators in Python modify functions or methods dynamically by wrapping them within another function using @decorator syntax."

"The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python ensures thread safety but limits true parallel execution in multi-threaded programs."

"Context managers use the 'with' statement and enter/exit methods to handle resource management cleanly."

"A stack in Python can be implemented using a list with append() for push and pop() for removal, following LIFO principles."

"A string can be reversed in Python using slice notation [::-1] or the reverse() method on a list."

"To find the first non-repeating character in a string, use a dictionary to track occurrences and return the first unique entry."

"Django is a full-stack framework with built-in ORM and authentication, while Flask is lightweight, micro-framework providing flexibility."

"Database migrations in Django are handled using makemigrations and migrate commands to reflect schema changes in the database."

"A RESTful API follows HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, using Flask or Django to create structured web services."

"Python applications can be deployed using Docker, AWS, Heroku, or cloud providers, ensuring portability and scalability."

"Docker enables containerization of Python applications, packaging dependencies and runtime in an isolated environment."

"Dependencies in Python projects are managed using pip, virtual environments, requirements.txt, or Poetry for isolation."

"A challenging bug I encountered involved a circular import issue in Flask, which I resolved using blueprint restructuring."

"I stay updated with Python developments through documentation, conferences, blogs, open-source contributions, and official PEP proposals."

"I want to work with your company because it aligns with my skills, offers growth opportunities, and has an innovative technical culture."
